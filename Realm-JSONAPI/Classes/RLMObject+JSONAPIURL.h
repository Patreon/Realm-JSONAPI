/**
 * This category handles decorating URLs with standard JSON:API query parameters.
 * In most cases, you should override `defaultAttributes` and `defaultRelationships`
 * to specify what your app expects to receive from the server in most cases.
 * Then, you can use `defaultURLDecoration:` to decorate a URL with the query parameters
 * needed to specify those desired attributes and relationships to the server.
 *
 * By explicitly requesting what you want, you make the server not have to guess.
 * This makes versioning a breeze, as it allows your server to change its defaults without breaking clients.
 *
 * If you want to break out of your defaults, you can use `fieldsIncludingRelationships:`
 * and modify its contents, then use `JSONAPIURLUtilities` to decorate your URL more manually.
